atomic-penguin's Community Cookbooks for Chef
=============================================

This repository is now deprecated.  Individual repositories have been filter-branched into their own cookbook trees.  This was done for ease of third party collaboration on individual cookbooks.  The upstream Opscode repository has also been filter-branched, and is available [here](http://github.com/opscode-cookbooks)

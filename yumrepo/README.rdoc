= DESCRIPTION:

Manages Yum Repository files in /etc/yum.repos.d on CentOS / RHEL 5.x

= REQUIREMENTS:

This cookbook requires RHEL or CentOS 5.x.  It has not been tested on
other platforms.  It probably will not work with RHEL 4 or CentOS 4,
especially if you have not taken the steps to install yum on that
platform.

The yumrepo::dell recipe requires Dell manufactured hardware.  This
recipe should automatically disable itself by default if non-Dell
hardware is detected by Ohai

The yumrepo::vmware-tools recipe requires a VMWare Virtual Machine.
This recipe should automatically disable itslef by default if
non-VMWare hardware is detected by Ohai.

Recipes tested with Ohai >= 0.5.6
